# Prepare
For the case study I will use the data provide by Google, using [this link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to access the data.
The data for this project should include the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data, which is from September 2020 to August 2021 by the time of the analysis. 

## Guiding questions
1. Where is your data located?
* *The data is located in the link above.* 

2. How is the data organized?
* *The data is seperated by month, each on it's own csv file.*
* *In each file, the data is organized by ID, time, and locations.* 

3. Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC?
* *No bias and credibility issues because of the data of the dataset is the client itself as riders. And the dataset is ROCCC, because it is reliable, original, comprehensive, current and cited.*

4. How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessility?
* *The company has their own [licence](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) over the dataset and the dataset does not include any personal information about the riders.*

5. How did you verify the data's integrity?
* *All data have consistent columns and every column has the correct datatype.* 

6. How does it help you answer your questions?
* *The data can help to identify trends and behaviour of the riders.*

7. Are there any problems with the data?
* *The data itself has no problems, but additional information about stations would be beneficial.*
