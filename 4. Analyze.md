# Analyze 
## Describtive analysis

Analysing rider_length: Mean, Median, Max and Min.

``` R
mean(data_cleaned$ride_length)
median(data_cleaned$ride_length)
max(data_cleaned$ride_length)
min(data_cleaned$ride_length)
```
It is also possible to use the summary command to get the same result as above.
```R
summary(data_cleaned$ride_length)
```

Compare the results between annual member with casual rider 
```R
aggregate(data_cleaned$ride_length ~ data_cleaned$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(data_cleaned$ride_length ~ data_cleaned$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(data_cleaned$ride_length ~ data_cleaned$member_casual, FUN = max)
aggregate(data_cleaned$ride_length ~ data_cleaned$member_casual, FUN = min)
```

## Further analysis

When do riders use the bike at the most throughout the week?
Seperate the date into weekdays starting with Monday. 
```R
aggregate(data_cleaned$ride_length ~ data_cleaned$member_casual + data_cleaned$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
data_cleaned$day_of_week <- ordered(data_cleaned$day_of_week, levels = c("Montag", "Dienstag", "Mittwoch", "Donnerstag", "Freitag", "Samstag", "Sonntag"))
aggregate(data_cleaned$ride_length ~ data_cleaned$member_casual + data_cleaned$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```

What bike type are casual and annual member are using?
```R
weekday_duration <- data_cleaned %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday, rideable_type) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n(),
            average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday, rideable_type) 
``` 

When do riders use the bike at the most throughout the year?
Seperate the data into month.
```R
month_duration <- data_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, month, year) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n(),
            average_duration = mean(ride_length))
``` 

## Export the summary file for future analysis
```R
counts <- aggregate(data_cleaned$ride_length ~ data_cleaned$member_casual + data_cleaned$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
write.csv(counts, file = 'C:\...\avg_ride_length.csv')
```

## Guiding questions

1. How should you organize your data to perform analysis on it?
* *The data has been organized into a single CSV file concatenating all previous 12 month of data.*

2. Has your data been properly formatted?
* *Yes, all colmns have their correct type.*

3. What surprises did you discover in the data?
* *One of the main surprises is how members differ from casuals when analysed from weekdays and also that members have less riding time than casual on average.*

4. What trends or relationships did you find in the data?
* *Casual riders ride more on weekend and members are spread on all weekdays.*
* *The duration time of members are shorter than casual riders.*
* *Members use more docked bikes.*
* *Month July has the most data.*

5. How will these insights help answer your business questions?
* *When is the best time to start a compagne.*
* *Which segment to target.*
